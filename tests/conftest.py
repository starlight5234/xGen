    Which driver xGen assumes is deliberately not sys.platform — it comes from
    the session's capabilities, falling back to the local platform backend, so
    that xGen on Windows can drive a remote Mac Appium server. That is right
    for the product and a trap for the tests: most of this suite asserts
    Windows behaviour against Windows-shaped input (SAMPLE_XML's Name= and
    AutomationId= attributes, Desktop Root targets, appTopLevelWindow
    capabilities, "application executable path" wording). Run on a macOS
    runner, all of that silently resolved to Mac2 vocabulary instead —
    @label/@title, application targets, bundle-ID wording — and seven tests
    failed for a reason that had nothing to do with what they were checking.

    So the default is pinned here rather than inherited from whichever machine
    happens to be running. Tests that are about another driver still override
    it the normal way: an explicit config.target_platform, or activating a
    dialect themselves, both take precedence over this.
